612-Setup
=========

This script will work for Ubuntu 13.10 "Saucy Salamander"
It is intended for the use of setting up programmers for Chnatilly Robotics,
but can be altered for any team that also uses ucpp.

Make sure to run this script in your robotics folder and with root privalages.
For all who are unsure, it should be something like 

sudo ~/robotics/612-Setup/ProgrammerSetup

This may not work on a school network, so it is better to do it at home.

Feel free to copy, alter and distribute as you please. If you have any questions, you 
may contact us by any of the many ways to contact us. 

This will install:

git
wine
curl
tcl
wput
python2.7
ucpp
